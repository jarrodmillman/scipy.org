We would like to make it easy for you to include the SciPy project identity in your next academic paper, course materials, or presentation. 

You will find several high-resolution versions of the SciPy logo [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/main/branding/logo). Note that by using the scipy.org resources, you accept the [SciPy Code of Conduct](/http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html).
